          In my early 20's, I discovered I had an intense love for food and entertaining. I started hosting parties for
          my
          friends and family- my main focus being on the food that was served. I loved making people feel full and happy
          and always wanted to be the perfect hostess!
          <br/>
          The spark of inspiration for the grazing boards and tables was born while I was on my honeymoon in Spain. I
          remember the first tapas bar I walked into - a massive spread of meats and cheeses and all things amazing! I
          was
          moved by the simplicity and convenience of this style of serving food. I came home and immediately made cheese
          and charcuterie boards my main focus! After many years, the boards continued to change and progress in every
          area from size to design. I now love to create simple, yet beautiful grazing boards and tables for all kinds
          of
          small gatherings, parties, and events.
          <br/>
          What I love most about these boards and tables is that the possibilities for creativity and uniqueness are
          absolutely endless. I have created a few custom boards that I think are fun and will fit most every style of
          grazer.
